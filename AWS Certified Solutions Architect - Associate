AWS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

1.How to ensure you do not go over a certain budget for AWS bill?

To ensure you do not exceed a certain budget for your AWS bill, you can 

Set Budgets in AWS Budgets: AWS provides a service called AWS Budgets that allows you to set cost and usage budgets for your AWS resources. 
You can define specific thresholds and receive email or SMS notifications when your actual costs or usage exceed those thresholds. 
This helps you stay informed about your spending and take timely actions to control costs.

Monitor and Analyze Cost and Usage: Utilize AWS Cost Explorer, a tool provided by AWS, to monitor and analyze your costs and usage patterns.

Remember, controlling costs in AWS is an ongoing process. Regularly monitor, analyze, 
and optimize your resource usage to ensure you stay within your budgetary limits and maximize cost-efficiency.

Reserved Instances and Savings Plans: Consider utilizing AWS Reserved Instances (RIs) or Savings Plans for long-term workloads with predictable usage.
These options offer significant discounts compared to on-demand instances. By planning your resource usage and leveraging reserved capacity, 
you can reduce costs over time.

Resource Optimization: Regularly review your resource utilization and identify opportunities for optimization. 
This includes rightsizing instances, terminating unused or idle resources, leveraging auto-scaling to match resource capacity with demand, 
and utilizing managed services that can provide cost savings compared to running and managing your own infrastructure.

Use Cost-effective Services and Pricing Models: Explore AWS services and pricing models that offer cost savings for your specific use case. 
For example, consider using AWS Lambda for serverless computing or Amazon S3 storage classes that suit your data access patterns and cost requirements.

Implement Cost Control Measures: Implement cost control measures within your organization, such as establishing budgetary policies, 
educating teams about cost-awareness, and implementing resource utilization guidelines. 
This fosters a cost-conscious culture and encourages responsible resource usage.


2.What is the alternative of doing everything from console?

The alternative to performing all actions from the AWS Management Console is to use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools such as AWS CloudFormation, 
AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit), or third-party tools like Terraform. These tools allow you to define your infrastructure and application resources in code,
 which can be version-controlled, automated, and executed programmatically.

Here are the main alternatives to using the AWS Management Console:

AWS CloudFormation: AWS CloudFormation is a service that enables you to define your infrastructure and application resources in YAML or JSON templates.
 You can describe your desired resources and their configurations, and CloudFormation provisions and manages those resources automatically. 
CloudFormation templates can be version-controlled, shared, and deployed using the AWS CLI, SDKs, or the CloudFormation console.
